============

Learn IT, girl Python project - database of craft beers available in Poland.
According to William Kerr, senior scientist at the Alcohol Research Group of the Public Health Institute (source: livescience.com), average ABV for beer is 4.5%. Fractions have never translated well into marketing (although, once upon a time we had a beer called "10.5" in Poland which was a huge freaking marketing success), so I decided that "4%" sounds kinda better.

This project is a scalable website with potential to easily adapt for other regions. It's a search/browse/commit project that's useful both for dedicated craft beer freaks and for casual consumers. It supports small, craft breweries and local entrepreneurs, giving them the platform to inform the world about their products, and to get some feedback as well.
