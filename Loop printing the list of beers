#  I learnt two methods of printing the contents of the file (see below):

#  Method 1

with open("C:\Documents and Settings\Koalka\Pulpit\\four_percent files\list of beers.csv") as in_file:
    text = in_file.read()
print(text)

#  Method 2
f = open("C:\Documents and Settings\Koalka\Pulpit\\four_percent files\list of beers.csv")

for line in f.readlines():
    line = line.strip()
    print(line)

#  Method 3
f = open("C:\Documents and Settings\Koalka\Pulpit\\four_percent files\list of beers.csv")
print(f.read())
